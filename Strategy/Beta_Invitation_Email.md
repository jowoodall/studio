**Subject:** Help me test my new app, MyRydz! (Carpooling made easy)

**Body:**

Hi [Friend's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

I'm reaching out because I've been working on a new web application called **MyRydz**, and I could really use your help. My goal is to make coordinating rydz for school, sports, and other kids' activities much simpler and safer for parents and students.

I'm now at a stage where I'm looking for a group of trusted friends and family to test it out before a wider release. I immediately thought of you!

**The Ask:**
Would you be willing to sign up for a free account, try creating a few events or carpools, and give me your honest feedback? I'm looking for input on:
*   What you like and dislike.
*   Any bugs or issues you encounter.
*   Any features you wish it had.
*   How easy (or difficult!) it is to use.

**How to Get Started:**
1.  [**Sign Up Here:**](https://studio--rydzconnect.us-central1.hosted.app/)
2.  Create an account (you can sign up as a Parent or Student).
3.  Explore the app: try creating a group, adding an event, or requesting a ryd.

Any feedback you can provide would be incredibly valuable as I continue to build and improve the app.

Thanks so much for your time and help!

Best,

[Your Name]
