# MyRydz Event Management

This document explains how to create, manage, and interact with events in the MyRydz application.

## What are Events?

Events are the destinations for which users coordinate rydz. An event can be anything from a soccer game or practice to a school play or a study session. Creating an event allows users to see a centralized point for carpooling.

## Creating a New Event

Any user can create a new event.

1.  Navigate to the **Events** page from the main sidebar.
2.  Click the **"Create New Event"** button.
3.  Fill in the required information:
    *   **Event Name:** The official name of the event (e.g., "Northwood High vs. Westwood High Football Game").
    *   **Event Date & Time:** The start and end time for the event.
    *   **Event Location:** The full address or name of the venue.
    *   **Event Type:** A category for the event (e.g., Sports, School, Community).
    *   **Description (Optional):** Any extra details, like parking information or meeting points.

Upon creation, you will automatically become the first **manager** of the event.

## Associating Events with Groups

One of the most powerful features is associating an event with your carpool groups.

-   **Visibility:** When you associate an event with one or more of your groups, it will automatically appear on the Events page for all members of those groups.
-   **How to Associate:** During event creation or when editing an event, you can select the groups you are a member of from a dropdown list.

This makes it easy to notify an entire team or club about a new event that requires carpooling without having to invite each person individually.

## Managing an Event

Only event **managers** can edit an event's details or manage other managers.

### Editing Event Details

1.  Navigate to the event's page.
2.  If you are a manager, you will see an **"Edit Event"** button.
3.  From the edit screen, you can change the event's name, time, location, associated groups, and other details.

### Managing Other Managers

1.  On the event's edit page, there is a "Manage Managers" section.
2.  You can **add a new manager** by entering their email address.
3.  You can also **remove** other managers from the event. An event must always have at least one manager.

This allows you to share the responsibility of keeping event details up-to-date with other trusted users, such as assistant coaches or other parents.
