# MyRydz Group Management

This document explains how to create, manage, and interact with carpool groups in the MyRydz application.

## What are Groups?

Groups are private collections of users (e.g., a soccer team, members of a study club, or just a group of friends) that make it easy to coordinate rydz for specific events. When an event is associated with a group, all members of that group can see the event and coordinate rydz for it.

## Creating a New Group

Any user can create a new group.

1.  Navigate to the **Groups** page from the main sidebar.
2.  Click the **"Create New Group"** button.
3.  Fill in the required information:
    *   **Group Name:** A descriptive name for your group (e.g., "Northwood High Soccer Parents").
    *   **Description:** A brief summary of the group's purpose.
    *   **Image URL (Optional):** A link to a picture for your group.
4.  Upon creation, you will automatically become the first **admin** of the group.

## Managing a Group

Only group **admins** can manage a group's members and settings.

### Inviting New Members

1.  From the main **Groups** page, click on the group you wish to manage.
2.  On the group details page, click the **"Manage Members"** button.
3.  In the "Add New Member" section, enter the email address of the user you want to invite.
4.  Click **"Invite Member"**.
5.  This will send an in-app notification to the user, inviting them to join your group.

### Member Status: Pending vs. Joined

When a user is first invited, their status is **"Pending Acceptance"**. They will appear in the member list but cannot yet participate in group events.

Once the user accepts the invitation from their **Groups** page, their status changes to **"Joined"**, and they become a full member of the group.

### Member Roles: Admin vs. Member

*   **Member:** A standard user who is part of the group. They can see group events and participate in group rydz.
*   **Admin:** A member who has additional privileges. Admins can:
    *   Invite new members.
    *   Remove any member from the group.
    *   Promote other members to admin status.
    *   Demote other admins to member status.

An admin can manage member roles from the **"Manage Members"** page.

### Removing a Member or Leaving a Group

*   **As an Admin:** You can remove any member (including other admins) from the **"Manage Members"** page. The only exception is that you cannot remove the last admin if other members are still in the group.
*   **As a Member:** You can leave a group at any time from the **"Manage Members"** page by clicking the remove icon next to your own name.

Once a user is removed or leaves, they will no longer see the group or its associated events.
