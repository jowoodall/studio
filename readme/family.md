# MyRydz Family Management

This document explains how to create and manage Family units in the MyRydz application.

## What are Families?

Families are different from carpool groups. While groups are for coordinating rydz for specific events, Families are designed for account management. A Family unit allows you to:

*   Link multiple user accounts together (e.g., parents, children,grandparents, guardians).
*   Manage a shared subscription plan for all members of the family (coming soon).
*   Provide a centralized point for billing and premium feature access.

## Creating a New Family

Any user can create a new Family.

1.  Navigate to the **My Family** page from your profile menu.
2.  Click the **"Create New Family"** button.
3.  Give your family a name (e.g., "The Johnson Family").
4.  Upon creation, you will automatically become the first **admin** of the family.

## Managing a Family

Only family **admins** can manage a family's members and settings.

### Adding New Members

1.  From the **My Family** page, click "Manage Family" on the family card you wish to manage.
2.  In the "Add New Member" section, enter the email address of the user you want to add.
3.  Click **"Invite Member"**. This will instantly add them to the family unit and send them a notification.

### Member Roles: Admin vs. Member

*   **Member:** A standard user who is part of the family. They will benefit from any shared subscription plan.
*   **Admin:** A member who has additional privileges. Admins can:
    *   Add new members.
    *   Remove any member from the family.
    *   Promote other members to admin status.
    *   Demote other admins to member status.
    *   Manage the family's subscription and billing details.

An admin can manage member roles from the **"Manage Family"** page.

### Removing a Member or Leaving a Family

*   **As an Admin:** You can remove any member (including other admins) from the **"Manage Family"** page. The only exception is that you cannot remove the last admin from the family.
*   **As a Member:** You can leave a family at any time from the **"Manage Family"** page by clicking the remove icon next to your own name.

Once a user is removed or leaves, they will no longer be associated with that family's subscription.
