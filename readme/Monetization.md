### Phase 3: Monetization System \(October-November 2025\)

1. Individual subscription system \(simpler implementation\)
2. Organization billing system
3. Admin dashboard for organizations
4. Payment processing integration

### Phase 4: Public Launch \(December 2025\)

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Initial Launch \(Local Market\):

- Leverage existing connections from user research
- Focus on schools and sports clubs in local area
- Build relationships with athletic directors and activity coordinators
- Create case studies and testimonials

### Expansion Strategy:

- **Within Schools**: Success with one team → approach other teams
- **Athletic Directors**: Use success stories for school-wide adoption
- **Referral Program**: Incentivize early adopters to recommend
- **League Approach**: One club success → approach entire league
- **Community Events**: Sponsor/present at sports banquets, parent nights
