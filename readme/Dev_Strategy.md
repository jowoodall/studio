# Development Strategy

## Development Strategy Option

### Option 1: Feature Flag Approach \(Recommended\)

**Build all features but gate them behind subscription checks**

**Pros:**

- Single codebase to maintain
- Easy A/B testing
- Smooth user experience \(features just "unlock"\)
- Can offer free trials of premium features
- Easier to debug and maintain

**Cons:**

- Slightly more complex initial development
- Premium features visible but locked \(could frustrate some users\)

## Recommended Rollout Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation \(August - During Stress Test\)

1. **Add subscription logic** to your Firebase backend
2. **Implement user tier checking** \(Free/Premium/Organization\)
3. **Create payment integration** \(Stripe setup\)
4. **Build basic admin dashboard** for organizations

### Phase 2: Feature Development \(September\)

**Priority Order Based on User Research:**

1. **Calendar Integration** \(highest demand\)
    - Start with Google Calendar \(most common\)
    - Add Outlook support
    - Two-way sync capability
2. **Route Optimization**
    - Google Maps API integration
    - Multi-stop route planning
    - ETA calculations
3. **Real-time Tracking**
    - Driver location sharing
    - Passenger notifications
    - Arrival time updates
4. **Driving Reports**
    - Trip history
    - Mileage tracking
    - Safety metrics

### Phase 3: Gradual Feature Rollout

**Beta Testing Strategy:**

- Release features to your stress test users first
- Gather feedback and iterate
- Gradually expand to broader user base

## Technical Implementation Questions

1. **User Management**: How will you handle the transition from free to paid? Immediate access or next billing cycle?
2. **Feature Visibility**: Should free users see premium features \(with upgrade prompts\) or completely hidden?
3. **Organization Admin**: Who manages the organization account - school admin, team coach, or parent volunteer?
4. **Data Migration**: How will you handle users who have existing data when they upgrade?

What's your preference on these approaches, and which technical aspects are you most concerned about implementing?
