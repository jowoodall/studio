# The Rydz Lifecycle: Requesting & Offering

This document explains the core functionality of the MyRydz application: how to get a ride and how to give a ride.

## Getting a Ryd (Passenger Journey)

There are two main ways for a passenger to get a ryd for an event.

### 1. Request a Ryd

This is the most common path. You are asking for someone to drive you.

1.  **Navigate to an Event:** Go to the **Events** page and select the event you need a ryd for.
2.  **Request a Ryd:** On the event's "Rydz" page, click the **"Request Ryd"** button.
3.  **Fill out the Details:** Provide your pickup location and the time you need to be at the event.
4.  **Submit:** Your request will now appear in the **"Requested Rydz"** section of the event page. Drivers who are going to that event can see your request and offer to fulfill it.

### 2. Join an Existing Ryd Offer

If a driver has already offered a ryd to the event, you can request to join them directly.

1.  **Find an Offer:** On the event's "Rydz" page, look at the **"Offered Rydz"** section.
2.  **Review the Details:** See the driver, their vehicle, and the number of available seats.
3.  **Request to Join:** Click the **"Request to Join"** button on the ryd offer you'd like to join.

## Giving a Ryd (Driver Journey)

As a driver, you can either create a general offer for an event or fulfill a specific request.

### 1. Offer a Ryd

This creates a new carpool that other users can request to join.

1.  **Navigate to an Event:** Go to the event you are willing to drive for.
2.  **Offer a Ryd:** Click the **"Offer a Ryd"** button.
3.  **Fill out the Details:** Provide your vehicle information, departure/arrival times, and the number of seats you have available.
4.  **Submit:** Your offer will now appear in the **"Offered Rydz"** section for passengers to see and join.

### 2. Fulfill a Ryd Request

You can directly fulfill a request that another user has made.

1.  **Find a Request:** On the event's "Rydz" page, look at the **"Requested Rydz"** section.
2.  **Select a Request:** Find a request that you can accommodate.
3.  **Offer to Fulfill:** Click the **"Offer to Fulfill"** button. This will take you to the same "Offer a Ryd" form, but it will be pre-filled with the context of fulfilling that specific request. After submitting, you have now created an active ryd with that user as a confirmed passenger.

## The Matching & Approval Process

Once a passenger requests to join a driver's ryd, a two-step approval process begins.

### 1. Parental Approval (for Students)

-   **Trigger:** If a student requests to join a ryd, the system first checks if the driver is on their parent's pre-approved list.
-   **Action:** If the driver is **not** pre-approved, a notification is sent to the parent. The request **does not** go to the driver at this stage. The parent must approve the request from their "Parental Controls" page.

### 2. Driver Approval

-   **Trigger:** Once a request is approved by a parent (or if no parental approval is needed), a notification is sent to the driver.
-   **Action:** The driver can then view the passenger's request on the "Ryd Tracking" page. They can choose to **Approve** or **Reject** the passenger.
-   **Confirmation:** The passenger receives a final notification confirming whether they have been added to the ryd.

## Ryd Process Stages

An active ryd goes through several stages from planning to completion.

-   **Awaiting Passengers / Planning:** This is the initial stage where a driver has offered a ryd but is still waiting for passengers to join, or is actively managing join requests.
-   **Ryd Planned:** The driver has confirmed the ryd plan. At this point, no new passengers can join.
-   **In Progress - Pickup:** The driver has started the ryd and is now on their way to pick up the passengers.
-   **In Progress - En Route:** All passengers have been picked up, and the driver is now en route to the final destination.
-   **Completed:** The driver has dropped off all passengers and marked the ryd as complete. Passengers will be prompted to rate their driver.
-   **Cancelled:** The ryd has been cancelled by either the driver or the system and will no longer proceed.
