# MyRydz User Profile

This document explains the features and sections available on your MyRydz profile page. Your profile is the central hub for managing your personal information, linked accounts, saved locations, and driving status.

## Accessing Your Profile

You can access your profile by clicking on your avatar in the top-right corner of the application and selecting "Profile" from the dropdown menu.

## User Information

The main section of your profile displays your key information at a glance:

*   **Avatar/Profile Picture:** Your current profile picture.
*   **Full Name, Email, and Bio:** Your personal details.
*   **Role:** Your designated role in the app (e.g., Parent, Student).

## Parent & Student Linking

This section changes depending on your role and is crucial for enabling parental controls.

### For Parents

*   **Manage My Students:** Parents will see a section where they can enter their student's email address to link their accounts. This allows the parent to manage ryd approvals for that student. This functionality has been expanded in the "Parental Controls" page.

### For Students

*   **My Parents/Guardians:** Students will see a section to enter their parent's email address. This links their account to the parent, allowing the parent to receive and respond to approval requests.

## Driver Details

If you have enabled the "I can drive" option, this section will display a summary of your driver-related information, such as your primary vehicle and passenger capacity. This is a read-only view on this page.

## My Locations

*   **Manage Saved Locations:** This section provides a quick link to the "My Locations" page where you can add, edit, or delete frequently used addresses like "Home," "School," or "Work."
*   **Purpose:** Maintaining this list makes creating ryd requests and offers much faster, as you can select from your saved locations instead of typing addresses each time.

## Editing Your Profile

To make changes to any of this information, click the **"Edit Profile"** button on the page. This will take you to a separate form where you can update your name, bio, avatar, phone number, and driver details.
